&raquo; VI, Function, &amp; How-To Help</i>.</para>
<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>
<para>
A delay has been included in Create Arbitrary Waveform in order to prevent Query Interrupted (-410) instrument error from
occurring.  The error occurs when error query is called from Create Arbitrary Waveform when a small transfer
(8-16 points) is sent over ther serial interface.
<br>
<br>
A delay occurs on the instrument after writing multiple arbitrary waveforms to a 33220A.  The instrument has a limited amount of flash memory, and
eventually must clean up the memory, this is when the delay occurs.
